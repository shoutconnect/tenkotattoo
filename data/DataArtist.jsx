        Meet Doris, with over 7 years of experience tattooing, Doris has defined
        her unique style as an artist. Specialising in Pop-Culture, Anime, Neo
        Traditional and the occasional Blackwork.
        <br />
        <br />
        When not tattooing, Doris loves to get creative with making jewellery,
        and can't help but rewatch the same classic shows.
        <br />
        <br />
        Heavily influenced by Japanese art, her vision when creating Tenko
        Tattoo was inspired by everything she really loves about the folklore
        and creativity of Japanese Culture.

        Sian began tattooing two years ago, and within this time, she has honed
        and defined her unique style. Embracing creativity in all its forms, she
        prefers to work with black and grey, specialising in intricate dot work
        designs.
        <br />
        <br /> Her dot work tattoos are characterised by their delicate details
        and stunning textures, as seen in her beautiful floral and geometric
        patterns. She also loves to tattoo bold ornamental designs and is keen
        to take on more large scale projects of this nature. <br />
        <br />
        In her spare time, Sian loves to indulge more in tattoo culture and
        visits many tattoo conventions while using this as an opportunity to
        travel and visit new places.

        Introducing Takey, who recently moved to the United Kingdom in 2023.
        With over 11 years in the tattoo industry, Takey previously owned his
        own studio in Hong Kong and couldnâ€™t wait to pick up his machine again.
        He joined Tenko Tattoo in May 2024.
        <br />
        <br />
        Not wanting to restrict his creativity to any one style, Takey has
        excelled in calligraphy, fine line, and oriental artwork, among others.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of the studio, Takey enjoys photography and occasionally
        indulges in woodworking projects.
