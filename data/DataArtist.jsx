        Doris has been tattooing for 8 years, after deciding she wanted nothing
        to do with takeaway shifts or parental expectations. In true Doris
        fashion, she went and did everything she was told not to — and built a
        career out of it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her style is bright, bold, and unapologetically cutesy, with a love for
        cartoony designs, video game references, anime, florals, and animals. If
        it’s fun, nerdy, or colourful, it’s right up her street. She’s currently
        leaning into coloured Japanese pieces too, bringing in more texture and
        detail without losing her signature playfulness.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside the studio, she’s either deep into Baldur’s Gate or soaking up
        every moment with her baby. When asked to share something random about
        herself, she said it’s basically just “work and baby” these days — so if
        you’re a client reading this and you’ve ever been surprised by something
        about her, let her know.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the studio, Doris brings solid mum energy — calm, capable, and always
        looking after everyone else while still managing to smash out some
        serious colour work.

        Abbie’s been tattooing for 5 years and has developed a bold,
        illustrative style that leans heavily into blackwork. She’s always loved
        drawing, and tattooing became a natural extension of that – a way to
        keep creating every day. Her work often features floral pieces, animals,
        and darker gothic themes, and she’s always up for anything in that
        world. Lately, she’s been interested in playing around more with muted
        colour to bring something a little different into her portfolio. <br />
        <br />
        When she’s not tattooing, you’ll probably find her in the garage working
        on cars and bikes with her dad – or at home surrounded by her 17 pets
        (yep, 17). Between the cats, dogs, and ferrets, there’s never a quiet
        moment… unless she’s gaming – she’s somehow clocked over 16,000 hours on
        a dinosaur survival game. <br />
        <br />
        In the studio, Abbie’s laid-back and chatty, making clients feel relaxed
        while working together to create something they’ll love.

        Aaron’s been tattooing for around 2.5 years, after getting into it out
        of pure spite — he was once told he couldn’t do art, so he went and
        proved them wrong. He’s always been one to doodle (or dewdle, as his
        name suggests), and tattooing gave him the perfect outlet to run with
        it.
        <br />
        <br />
        His style leans towards traditional-ish-inspired blackwork, with a love
        for bold lines, strong contrast, and the occasional bat. While his work
        often heads into the morbid, Aaron himself is anything but — he’s the
        loud, energetic one in the studio who somehow still manages to make his
        tattoos feel clean, solid, and balanced. He currently looks to
        experiment more with opaque greys in his blackwork, pushing his style
        while still keeping things bold and readable. <br />
        <br />
        Outside the studio, you’ll find him gaming, dancing to Kate Bush in his
        kitchen with his cat, or getting drunk, again with his cat. He also
        lives on a farm and assists with lambing season... in his words, “I fist
        sheep.” We’ll leave it at that.
        <br />
        <br /> Loud, lively, and always up for a laugh — Aaron brings big energy
        to Tenko, and clients love him for it.

        Sian began tattooing two years ago, and within this time, she has honed
        and defined her unique style. Embracing creativity in all its forms, she
        prefers to work with black and grey, specialising in intricate dot work
        designs.
        <br />
        <br /> Her dot work tattoos are characterised by their delicate details
        and stunning textures, as seen in her beautiful floral and geometric
        patterns. She also loves to tattoo bold ornamental designs and is keen
        to take on more large scale projects of this nature. <br />
        <br />
        In her spare time, Sian loves to indulge more in tattoo culture and
        visits many tattoo conventions while using this as an opportunity to
        travel and visit new places.

        Introducing Takey, who recently moved to the United Kingdom in 2023.
        With over 11 years in the tattoo industry, Takey previously owned his
        own studio in Hong Kong and couldn’t wait to pick up his machine again.
        He joined Tenko Tattoo in May 2024.
        <br />
        <br />
        Not wanting to restrict his creativity to any one style, Takey has
        excelled in calligraphy, fine line, and oriental artwork, among others.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of the studio, Takey enjoys photography and occasionally
        indulges in woodworking projects.
